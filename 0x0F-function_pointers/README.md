0x0F. C - Function pointers Prototypes

0. What's my name (Write a function that prints a name.)
1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done (Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.)
2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities (Write a function that searches for an integer.)
3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at (Write a program that performs simple operations.)
    This task requires that you create four different files.
    3-calc.h (This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.)
    3-op_functions.c (This file should contain the 5 functions)
    3-get_op_func.c (This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.)
    3-main.c (This file should contain your main function only)
4. Advanced task
